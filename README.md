# Stick Lite
Stick Lite is a stripped-down version of Stick, written in V for the Arch User Repository (AUR), designed to be as minimal as possible. It removes nearly all non-essential features, keeping only the core functionality needed to install and manage packages. Perfect for extremely old or resource-constrained systems where every byte matters.

## **Disclaimer**  
Stick Lite is still in active development and is **not yet ready for use**.  
While this repository already includes the README, documentation, and other project files, the package manager itself is currently inaccessible and incomplete.
